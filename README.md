Analysis of AI usage impact on engineering delivery risk

# AI-Assisted Engineering Delivery Risk Analysis

This project analyzes how AI tool usage relates to engineering delivery performance and risk.

## 📊 Analysis Covered
- Descriptive performance trends (Cycle Time, MTTR, Failure Rate)
- AI vs Non-AI task comparison
- Task complexity influence
- Risk pattern identification

## 🧠 Key Insight
AI usage appears in higher-risk work mainly because AI is used more often in complex tasks. Task complexity is the primary driver of delivery risk, not AI alone.

## 🏗 System Design Included
This repository also includes system design concepts for an AI-driven delivery risk monitoring platform:

- Causal relationship model
- Policy-based risk decision flow
- AI-assisted risk monitoring architecture

## 📁 Files Included
- Final Report (PDF)
- Excel analysis with pivot tables
- System design diagrams

## 🎯 Objective
Demonstrate how organizations can adopt AI safely using context-aware risk monitoring instead of restricting AI blindly.
